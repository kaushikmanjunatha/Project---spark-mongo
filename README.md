This project focuses on the classification of vehicle images into their respective categories. Utilizing the power of deep learning models, the system is designed to accurately identify different types of vehicles from image data.

Given the large size of the dataset, this project also serves as an excellent learning opportunity to explore and implement big data technologies. Specifically, I have integrated PySpark for efficient data processing and MongoDB for effective data management.

**Data Source**

The vehicle dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle, which provides a diverse collection of vehicle images. This rich dataset is instrumental in training the deep learning model for accurate classification.

**Key Features**

Deep Learning Model: Leverages advanced neural network architectures to classify vehicle images.
Big Data Technologies: Utilizes PySpark for handling large-scale data and MongoDB for database management, demonstrating the integration of big data solutions in machine learning projects.

**How to Run**

Ensure you have the necessary libraries and frameworks installed, including PySpark and MongoDB.
Clone the repository.
Download the dataset from the provided Kaggle link and set up your environment.
Run the Jupyter Notebook to initiate the training process and test the model.
